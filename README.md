### Problem Statement

In this project, you will create a recommendation system for restaurants using collaborative filtering (CF). You will be using the Yelp Dataset for this.

The general structure of a recommendation system is that there are users and there are items. Users express explicit or implicit preferences towards certain items.

### The data: https://www.yelp.com/dataset

### Please read about the dataset here: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main

Outline of this Project We want you to work on these two subtopics for the project:

Base Model: The base model is to answer the question for the user - "give me more restaurants like this one" Create a database of item-item similarities. Build a CF-based Recommender system using Stochastic Gradient Descent. (70% of the project score)

Your way to improve the project - do further data analysis on the dataset and see if you can make an improvement to the base model created in part 1. This can be adding new features to the dataset to recommend the specific restaurant to users or to classify between two overlapping categories like nightlife and bars or restaurants and fast-food or checking how well a new restaurant will do in a certain neighborhood (30% of the project score)

### Don't Overscope üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This project can be either very simple or very challenging depending on how far you'd like to go. It's impossible to try everything in one and a half weeks, so scope your project wisely. The bottom line is every group member should completely understand everything the group attempted.

Don't use a model/algorithm you don't understand just because it performs better. The goal of the project is to practice what you learned, hone your research skills, and ‚Äì most importantly ‚Äì have great fun!

#### NOTE - Remember that the scope of this project is algorithms covered in this course. You may use one additional algorithm of your choice, provided you are fully aware of how it works.
